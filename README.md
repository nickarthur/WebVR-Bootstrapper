# WebVR-Bootstrapper

When you are making a WebGL experience, it often requires downloading a large number of files. When you're working in VR, you don't want the user to have to start at pitch blackness, or take off their HMD. So WebVR-Bootstrapper is a minimal set of code meant to download quickly and get an image int the HMD that can then show a progress bar to load the rest of the project.
